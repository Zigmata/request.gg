	<h1>Terms of Service for ReQuest</h1>
	<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 4, 2025</p>

	<section>
		<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
		<p>
			This is a binding agreement. By adding, inviting, or using the ReQuest Discord bot ("Service"),
			provided by ReQuest ("we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by
			these Terms of Service ("Terms").
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service. That means, politely,
			kicking the bot from your server.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
		<p>
			The Service is a Discord bot designed to assist with the administration of Tabletop
			Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs). Its features include, but are not limited to, managing quests,
			player inventories, custom currencies, and role-based access for game-related tasks.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>3. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
		<p>You agree to use the Service in compliance with two things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All applicable local, state, national, and international laws.</li>
			<li>
				The <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>Discord Terms of Service</a
				> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>Discord Community Guidelines</a
				>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You are solely responsible for the data and content you and your server members input into the
			Service. You agree not to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
			<li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or hack the Service.</li>
			<li>Use the Service to harass, abuse, or harm another person.</li>
			<li>
				Input any data that is obscene, defamatory, or violates the privacy of any third party.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>4. User-Generated Content</h2>
		<p>
			You (and your users) retain all ownership rights to the content you create and input into the
			Service (such as quest descriptions, item names, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			However, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use,
			store, process, and display this content
			<strong>solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Service to you</strong>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>5. Termination</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Termination by You:</strong> You may terminate this agreement at any time, for any
			reason, by removing the Service (the bot) from all Discord servers you control.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Termination by Us:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access
			to the Service at any time, for any reason (but especially if you violate these Terms or the
			Discord ToS), with or without notice.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>This is the "as-is" part.</strong> The Service is provided "as-is" and
			"as-available" without any warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the Service will
			be error-free, uninterrupted, or 100% available.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>We are not responsible for data loss.</strong> We build this Service with care, but
			we are not liable for any loss of data (e.g., if a database error eats your party's
			hard-earned inventory). We strongly recommend keeping your own backups of important game
			information.
		</p>
		<p>
			To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for any indirect,
			incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your
			use of the Service.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to
			notify users of significant changes (e.g., via the bot's status message or a support server),
			but it is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
		</p>
		<p>Continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
		<p>
			This is the part where you need to decide what jurisdiction's laws apply. We're AI, not
			lawyers. You should fill this in after consulting a legal professional.
		</p>
		<p>
			These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
			<strong>State of Nevada, United States</strong>, without regard to its conflict of
			law provisions.
		</p>
	</section>
